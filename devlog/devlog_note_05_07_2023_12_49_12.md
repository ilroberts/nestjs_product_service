just testing out the use of the devlog tool. I have aliased it to ```dl```, including the path the develog directory. 

Next thing to do for the ***product api*** is:

* [ ] implement the get product by id
* [ ] implement the update product
* [ ] implement the delete product

## the products module

I removed the product module and put everything into the app module. I will have to see what I can do to move the product specific stuff into a product module. Need to some reading on how nestjs implements modules

## other stuff to make the service more realistic

* [ ] add a [health check](https://docs.nestjs.com/recipes/terminus)
